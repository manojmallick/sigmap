Latest saved run: **2026-09-08 (v8.31.0)**

**Result:** SigMap finds the right file in the top 5 far more often than chance — **81.1% hit@5** vs **13.6%** random baseline across 105 tasks on 18 real repos.

## Why this benchmark matters

When a coding assistant misses the key file, everything downstream gets worse:

- more retries
- more clarifying questions
- more wrong-context answers

This benchmark isolates that first question: *did the right file appear in context?*

## Headline numbers

| Metric | Without SigMap | With SigMap |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| Average hit@5 (grep-agent baseline) | 44.0% | **81.1%** |
| Graph-boosted hit@5 | — | **81.1%** |
| Honest lift (vs single-shot grep, `benchmark:honest`) | — | **1.73x** |
| Random-selection hit@5 (data only, no longer quoted) | 13.6% | — |
| Correct (rank 1) | ~1% | **64.8%** |
| Partial (ranks 2–5) | ~13% | **17.1%** |
| Wrong (not in top 5) | ~86% | **18.1%** |

## Quality tiers from the saved run

| Tier | Tasks | Share |
|---|---:|---:|
| Correct | 68 / 105 | **64.8%** |
| Partial | 18 / 105 | **17.1%** |
| Wrong | 19 / 105 | **18.1%** |

## Hard split and size buckets (new in v8.22)

Most benchmark queries share tokens with the filenames they expect (`absl Time
Duration TimeZone` → `absl/time/time.h`) — so a high hit@5 partly measures
filename matching. v8.22 adds a **no-leakage hard split**: a task may be
labeled `"split": "hard"` only if its BM25-tokenized query shares **no stemmed
token** with its expected files' basenames. `scripts/validate-task-corpus.mjs`
enforces this in CI (it also measured that **90 of 110 pre-existing easy tasks
leak**). `benchmark:honest` reports both splits, plus per-repo-size buckets
(<200 / ≤1000 / >1000 files scanned on disk):

| Slice | Tasks | SigMap hit@5 | Grep baseline |
|---|---:|:---:|:---:|
| Easy split | 110 | **76.4%** | 43.6% |
| **Hard split** | 15 | **33.3%** | **53.3%** |
| Small repos | 13 | 84.6% | 69.2% |
| Medium repos | 52 | 44.2% | 46.2% |
| Large repos | 60 | 91.7% | 38.3% |

The hard split is published deliberately: with filename leakage removed, the
single-shot grep baseline currently **beats** SigMap. That is the measured
vocabulary-mismatch ceiling — the number repo-mined query expansion (planned
for v9.0) exists to move. When it moves, this table is the proof.

## What the benchmark does not measure

This benchmark does **not** score answer wording, correctness of prose, or stylistic quality. It measures a narrower prerequisite:

> whether the right source file is present in the ranked context.

That is why it pairs well with [judge](/guide/judge) and the [task benchmark](/guide/task-benchmark).

## Reproduce

```bash
node scripts/run-retrieval-benchmark.mjs --save
node scripts/run-retrieval-benchmark.mjs --json
```

For the full multi-benchmark dashboard:

```bash
node scripts/run-benchmark-matrix.mjs --save --skip-clone
```

### Third-party reproducible harness (v8.8.0+)

For a **self-contained** run that anyone can reproduce from a clean checkout — no dev tooling required, only `git` and Node 18+ — use the [`public-benchmarks/`](https://github.com/manojmallick/sigmap/tree/main/public-benchmarks) harness. It pins 18 repos to exact commits (`repos.csv`), ships the 90 queries (`queries.json`), clones + maps + scores in one command, and ranks with the **shipped** BM25 ranker:

```bash
cd public-benchmarks
./run.sh            # clone pinned repos (shallow) + score → hit@1/hit@5/MRR
./run.sh --json     # also write results.json
```

Because the repos are pinned and the map is byte-stable, the harness returns the **same numbers on any machine** — turning the headline hit@5 from a claim into a third-party-verifiable fact (v9.0 G1). Zero deps, no LLM, no API keys.
