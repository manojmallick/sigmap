# SigMap vs alternatives

SigMap solves the same problem as embeddings, RAG, and compressed context tools — but from a different angle. This page is a direct comparison.

## SigMap vs embeddings / RAG

Embedding-based retrieval is the default mental model most developers reach for. SigMap takes the opposite approach.

| | SigMap | Embeddings / RAG |
|---|---|---|
| Dependencies | **Zero** | Vector DB, embedding model, infra |
| Setup time | **30 seconds** | Hours to days |
| Latency per query | **< 100 ms** | 200 ms–2 s+ (network + model) |
| Determinism | **Always same result** | Varies with model drift and index staleness |
| Offline / air-gapped | **Yes** | Rarely |
| Cost per query | **Free** | $0.01–$0.10+ |
| Explainability | **Ranked signature list** | Black-box similarity score |
| Maintenance | **None** | Index rebuild on every schema change |

SigMap uses TF-IDF over extracted function signatures — no vectors, no infra, no drift. The tradeoff is that it only works well with code (which is the use case).

::: tip When to use embeddings instead
If your retrieval target is free-form documentation, markdown, or natural-language artifacts rather than source code signatures, embeddings may be a better fit. SigMap is optimized for code.

## SigMap vs RepoMix

RepoMix compresses files. SigMap extracts what matters and ranks by relevance.

| | SigMap | RepoMix |
|---|---|---|
| Token reduction | **97–98%** | ~90% |
| Retrieval accuracy (hit@5) | **78.9%** | 13.6% (random-equivalent) |
| Query-aware context | **Yes** — ranked per query | No — same output every time |
| Dependency graph | **Yes** — import-aware BFS | No |
| Learn from usage | **Yes** — `sigmap learn` | No |
| Validate coverage | **Yes** — `sigmap validate` | No |
| Judge answer groundedness | **Yes** — `sigmap judge` | No |
| Works with MCP tools | **Yes** — 9 tools | No |

The key difference: RepoMix's output is the same regardless of what you ask. SigMap's output is ranked to the specific query, which is why retrieval accuracy is 5.8× higher.

## SigMap vs Copilot / IDE context window

Copilot and other AI IDEs send everything they can see in the open editors. SigMap sends only what the current query needs.

| | SigMap | IDE context (Copilot, etc.) |
|---|---|---|
| Selection strategy | **Query-ranked signatures** | Recent open files |
| Token cost per session | **~200–4,000 tokens** | ~8,000–80,000 tokens |
| Works across all editors | **Yes** | IDE-specific |
| Validates coverage | **Yes** | No |
| Judges answer groundedness | **Yes** | No |
| Reproducible | **Yes** | No — depends on open files |
| MCP-native | **Yes** — 9 tools | Partial |

Copilot and SigMap are complementary: Copilot sends the live editor context, SigMap sends the ranked codebase map. Many teams use both.

## SigMap vs manual context curation

Some teams maintain a hand-written `AGENTS.md` or instructions file. SigMap generates and keeps it current automatically.

| | SigMap | Hand-written instructions |
|---|---|---|
| Keeps up with code changes | **Yes** — regenerates on every commit | Manual update required |
| Structured by module | **Yes** — per-module signature blocks | Usually flat text |
| Benchmark-tested accuracy | **78.9% hit@5** | Not measured |
| Time to set up | **30 seconds** | Hours |

## What SigMap does not replace

- **Full-text search** — SigMap extracts signatures, not full source. If you need to search comment text or string literals, `grep` is still the right tool.
- **LSP / go-to-definition** — SigMap is a context layer, not a language server. It does not provide hover types or jump-to-definition.
- **Security scanning** — SigMap redacts secrets from context output but is not a SAST tool.

## Summary

| Need | Best fit |
|---|---|
| Fast, accurate, zero-infra code context | **SigMap** |
| Searching prose / documentation | Embeddings |
| Compressing code for LLM input (no query) | RepoMix |
| IDE-integrated inline suggestions | Copilot / IDE plugin |
| Deep semantic search across heterogeneous content | RAG pipeline |
